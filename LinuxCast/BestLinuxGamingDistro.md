# Best Linux Gaming Distribution

Hi, welcome to LinuxCast a podcast dedicated to all things Linux.

Today's topic is the best linux distribution for gaming out of the box. Any Linux distro would do just fine for gaming, as long as you have the skills and the patience to set it up. But we are talking about the out of the box experience. This for people with beginner to moderate linux skills or who just don't have the time and patience to setup a system from scratch. For example install arch linux and built it to become a gaming machine. I dare to say the majority of linux gamers will fall in this category.

The answer is ... Pop Os, a linux distribution made by system76. I hope you enjoyed our podcast see you next time.

Just kidding such statement needs an explanation .... why?
Few reasons:

- Hardware compatibility. It is a distribution based on Ubuntu. Ubuntu has it own hardware compatibility team that makes sure Ubuntu runs out of the box on as many configurations possible. This means drivers and tweaks built in the operating system. On top of that system76 sells laptops and desktop computers with Pop Os preinstalled. This means they have their own hardware compatibility team. Lastly they install the latest graphics drivers from nvidia, amd and intel for the best experience.

- Rolling release.
