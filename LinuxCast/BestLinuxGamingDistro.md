# Best Linux Gaming Distribution

Hi, welcome to LinuxCast a podcast dedicated to all things Linux.

Today's topic is the best linux distribution for gaming out of the box. Any Linux distro would do just fine for gaming, as long as you have the skills and the patience to set it up. But we are talking about the out of the box experience. This is for people with beginner to moderate linux skills or who just don't have the time and patience to setup a system from scratch. For example install arch linux and built it to become a gaming machine. I dare to say the majority of linux gamers will fall in this category.

So the correct title of this podcast should really be: Best linux gaming distro for most people.

The answer is ... Pop Os, a linux distribution made by system76. I hope you enjoyed our podcast see you next time.

Just kidding such statement needs an explanation .... why?
Few reasons:

- Hardware compatibility. It is a distribution based on Ubuntu. Ubuntu has it own hardware compatibility team, that makes sure Ubuntu runs out of the box on as many configurations possible. This means drivers and tweaks built in the operating system. On top of that, system76 sells laptops and desktop computers with Pop Os preinstalled. This means they have their own hardware compatibility team. Lastly they install the latest graphics drivers from nvidia, amd and intel for the best experience.

Considering hardware demand of most modern games, you will probably have newish hardware, therefore you want the latest drivers. 

- Rolling updates. System76 gives you whatever updates are ready when they are ready. Meaning after some testing has been done you get the latest updates compatible with your system. As opposed to Ubuntu were you will have to wait 6 months for the next release. This will again increase gaming compatibility.

- Pop shop. Their package repository is called pop shop. This has by default steam, lutris, wine and most things you need to get started at a press of a button. Including but not limited to vulkan libraries.

- Lastly the os comes without bells and whistles, therefore it is light and doesn't use unnecessary resources, living more for your games.

So how come not all linux Gamers are using it.
One major drawback is the os is not intended for beginners nor for experts. It comes by with Gnome's default interface. This at first glance is intimidating for new users especially those with windows background and some customization needs to be done to make the system more appealing.
And for those with more linux experience, who do not mind compiling packages and install latest drivers, there are better, lighter distributions out there like the aforementioned Arch linux.

That is all for today.

Take care, good bye.
